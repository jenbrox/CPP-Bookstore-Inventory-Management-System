/*
 * ISSUES:
 * (1) Am I adding the authors correctly? Switch case 1.
 * (2) Make NEW book object each time. Naming issue, so use new? but pointers?
 * (3) Give book to Inventory object in all options of Switch case 1. (send book object to addBook())
 * (4) Is my getter and setter for authors[] correct?
 * (5) Create a way to make a book ID from Title and Author, and put in Switch Case 1.
 * (6) On the search() in Inventory I need to make a way to give back an error if the book is not found
 * hence the index = 199. Need to finish this somehow.
 * (7) Create a toString for Case 5 (and 4)
 * (8) The char case issue. Not easily found online.

 * ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
 * This program manages an inventory system for a bookstore to manage book objects. The inventory of the books
 * is in the Inventory class.
 *
 * For 1: Ask user what information they would like to provide (choice between three constructors). Then ask
 * that info and add to the constructor and place in inventory. Create ID at that time combining two variables?
